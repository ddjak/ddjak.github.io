title: Document -- Don't Create
--- 
I felt paralyzed whenever I had to post something online. It had to be original, creative, something that would change the world. 
I was also secretive and wanted to keep all my treasured goodies hidden so no one would steal them -- yeah right.
The perspective that changed that mentality for me was to document -- not create. There is so much that goes on in a day. 
Every day gives the opportunity to adventure into deeper jungles. Why worry about constantly creating new things when the world
provides plenty of amazing and strange things to write down?
